The folders contain the different versions of the continually refactored
example used in <https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills>.

The numbers do not correspond to the number of the nix-pills article;
they are simply sequential.

The main file in each directory contains a comment at the top with
instructions how to run the build command.
